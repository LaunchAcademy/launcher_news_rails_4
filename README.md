## README

This is a simple news site used for demoing a basic Rails 4.0 application. Requires Ruby 1.9.3 or greater to be installed.

To get up and running, run the following from your Terminal:

    git clone git://github.com/LaunchAcademyEDU/launcher_news
    cd launcher_news

    bundle install
    rake db:setup

    rails server

At this point you should have a local Rails server running on port 3000. Simply visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view your new app!
